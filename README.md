# Task - Array Manipulation

Function getUniqueElements uses an object mp to efficiently keep track of unique elements encountered in the input array. It iterates through the input array, checks if the element is present in the mp. If not, it adds the element to both the mp and the resultArray, ensuring only unique elements are included in the resultArray.

# Task - Object Operations

The function mergeObjects that combines properties from two objects. It merges functions and non-function properties. If both objects have functions with the same key, it renames one function to avoid overwriting, ensuring all properties are included in the resulting merged object.
